A creative and tech-savvy 3rd grader who enjoys playing on her dad-built desktop, exploring VR, and drawing with her iPad and Apple Pencil. She’s an active athlete, currently on a basketball team with 4 years of soccer under her belt—and is considering volleyball next! She is also a proud **Girl Scout**, learning new skills and making a difference in her community.

When she’s not outdoors on her hoverboard or bike, she enjoys playing Minecraft, Roblox, and board games like checkers and “Sorry!” (with a funny flick of the finger). She's a fan of sushi, especially California rolls, and loves all things artsy, crafty, and anime-related. Her favorite characters include *Oogie Boogie*, *Care Bears*, and *Transformers*; also, she’s got a soft spot for cats, pumpkins, sharks, and squishmallows.

A mix of tech, sports, creativity, and adventure, Corinne is always up for fun! 🌟
